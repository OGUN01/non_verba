## Data Flow

1. **Generate**: AI generates question → Initialize with null/empty → Save to localStorage
2. **Review**: User adds rating/comment → Updates state → Saves to localStorage
3. **Export**: Load from localStorage → Export as JSON (includes rating/comment)
4. **Import**: Parse JSON → Normalize fields → Save to localStorage → Display

## Backward Compatibility

The system handles three scenarios:
1. **New questions from AI**: rating/comment initialized automatically
2. **Legacy localStorage data**: Fields added on load
3. **Legacy imported JSON**: Fields added during import validation

All paths converge to the same normalized structure ensuring consistency.
